# MB Book Search Engine

## Description

For this weeks challenge we where given a starter code application of a restful api that is a Book Search Engine. We had to convert it over to MERN. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React and Node. I converted this application to test my skills and I would like to think I have improved.
